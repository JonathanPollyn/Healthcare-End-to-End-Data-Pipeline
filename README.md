# Healthcare Data Platform Project

This repository provides an end-to-end walkthrough of a healthcare data platform encompassing data engineering, data analytics, and a forthcoming machine learning component. This is part of an educational webinar series focused on practical data science applications using healthcare-related datasets.

## üîÅ ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

This section contains the pipeline used to ingest, clean, and prepare healthcare data using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and schema design.

### Contents:
- **Data/**: Raw data files used for transformation.
- **SSIS Package/**: Contains SSIS project for automating ETL operations.
- **ER Diagram**: Entity-Relationship diagram for database structure.
- **healthcare_schema - Create Scripts.sql**: SQL scripts to create tables and schemas for the PatientCentricDB.

---

## üìä Data Analytics

This module focuses on the transformation and visualization of healthcare data to extract insights for reporting and decision-making.

### Contents:
- **HealthCare Analysis.pbix**: Power BI report dashboard providing visual insights into patient-provider interactions and outcomes.
- **HealthCareAnalysis_Patient_Provider.sql**: SQL queries used for data extraction and analytics.
- **PatientCentricDB/**: Contains structured healthcare datasets for querying and reporting.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning (Coming Soon)

This section will implement a machine learning model to **predict diabetes** risk among patients using structured health records. The model will be deployed using **Streamlit** to provide a user-friendly interface for inference.

---

## üß† Learning Objectives

- Design healthcare data pipelines using SSIS and SQL.
- Build meaningful data models and dashboards using Power BI.
- Apply predictive analytics using Python and Streamlit (in development).
